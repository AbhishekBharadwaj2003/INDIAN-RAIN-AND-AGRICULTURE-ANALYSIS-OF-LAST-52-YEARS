52 Years of Agriculture & Rainfall Analysis in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
Just completed a comprehensive data analysis and forecasting project based on official data from the Government of India, covering:

âœ… Rainfall & crop data across 20 Indian states (1966â€“2017)
 âœ… Insights into the production of 30+ crops over 5+ decades
 âœ… Forecasted overall wheat production using both time series and machine learning techniques
 âœ… State-wise forecasting for Assam and West Bengal

ðŸ“Œ Tech stack:
 ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
 ðŸ”¹ Forecasting using Linear Regression from sklearn.linear_model
 ðŸ”¹ Time series analysis with statsmodels
 ðŸ”¹ Visualizations in Jupyter Notebook

This project helped me strengthen my skills in EDA, visualization, and building predictive models from real-world datasets. ðŸŒ±
